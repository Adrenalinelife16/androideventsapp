Make sure you are using the latest Android SDK and Build tools. If you do get errors when you import the project it mostly is related to using 
the wrong version of the SDK or Build tools. 

The easiest way to resolve these issues is to make sure the project uses the latest version of the SDK by select the SDK, 
right click on the app folder and select Open Module Settings(F4)

In the Properties Tab change: 
Compile Sdk Version: <select latest>
Built Tools Version: <select latest>

Select the Dependancies Tab ensure you have the following:
com.google.android.gms:play-services:8.4.0
com.android.support:support-v12:23.1.1 or latest version

Click Ok 

Your project should now build
